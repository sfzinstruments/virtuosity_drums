Beta 0.924
Applied user-provided fix with ride and flat ride where the fourth round robin would not play if velocity was exactly 44.

Beta 0.923
Fixed problem with hi-hat slider visibility in hi-hat GUI for pedal (CC 4) use

Beta 0.922
Off-mode set to normal under every global, so mute times should work as intended now
Whistle self-muting fixed so it works now

Beta 0.921
Bug with note-selfmasking fixed - details below
Polyphony limiting now is three per mic per key in general, except for snare roll keys which get 6, and hi-hat which gets max because the silence groups there can cause problems
Group numbers added under master headers for mics to get the note_polyphony to keep a separate counter for each mic - kludgy but I'll take it
Fixed bleed controls in basic kit which were totally wrong in 0.920

Beta 0.920
Polyphony doesn't work well with multiple mics on
Polyphony limit switched from per kit piece to per key, so note_selfmask will be used and quiet hits won't kill louder ones unrealistically
Hi-hat keys have note_polyphony=MAX because without that stuff behaved weirdly and I don't have time to figure it out properly but this works
Hi-hat, triangle and conga should still have more muted articulations mute less-muted ones

Beta 0.910
User guide now exists
Hi-hat mute time extended and turned into a parameter set in the keymap file
Hi-hat splash no longer mutes any of the articulations except itself - on paper it "should" but it's quiet and that exposes that the muting is a simple fadeout
Hi-hat silence file comments fixed
Leaving mute groups as they are for now... doing note_polyphony and note_selfmask might be superior, and only using groups for hi-hat, triangle, conga and cuica, but kinda late now and trying to fix this would likely make a giant mess

Beta 0.900
Tambourine and shaker timing tightened
Some perc slightly louder
Controls laid out on GUI now
GUI has pedal and non-pedal versions
Alternate keymaps added
Unused roll end samples deleted
No user guide yet
Leaving kick dampen, snare roll endings and perc samples in WAV for now

Beta 0.520
Timbales added
Master tune moved from CC91 to 90
Info tab image updated, links in roughly correct locations
No user guide yet
Control tab is still a placeholder and has hi-hat pedal control which does nothing unless the mapping is reconfigured
Kick dampen still probably too aggressive
Snare roll ends still probably too loud
Perc samples are WAV, not FLAC but that's probably OK

Beta 0.510
All GM perc now present except for timbales, though cuica, vibraslap and woodblock only have OH mics
Basic kit now includes GM perc also
Cuica and whistle intentionally not affected by epic controls
No user guide yet
GUI is still a placeholder and has hi-hat pedal control which does nothing unless the mapping is reconfigured
Kick dampen still probably too aggressive
Snare roll ends still probably too loud
Perc samples are WAV, not FLAC but that's probably OK

Beta 0.500
Some General MIDI percussion added for close, OH, mid and room mics, with the close being under the snare mic control
No user guide yet
GUI is still a placeholder and has hi-hat pedal control which does nothing unless the mapping is reconfigured
Kick dampen still probably too aggressive
Snare roll ends still probably too loud
Perc samples are WAV, not FLAC

Beta 0.410
WAV samples replaced with FLAC except for snare rolls (which have embedded loop points)
Epic control simplified to one knob
No user guide yet
GUI is still a placeholder and has hi-hat pedal control which does nothing unless the mapping is reconfigured
Kick dampen still probably too aggressive
Snare roll ends still probably too loud

Beta 0.400
Basic patch and single mic patches now have the proper contents
All controls are now functional except hi-hat pedal, which can be configured to be functional by editing the mapping file
Each of the non-close mics now has its own epic control
Snare roll ends work better (but are probably too loud)
Backslashes in SFZ files replaced with forward slashes
GUI is still a placeholder
Still WAV

Alpha 0.300
XML bank for Sforzando now included
Basic GUI done but pretty bad
All patches right now are actually the full patch
Kick dampen control probably still too aggressive
Cymbal tune replaced with master tune
Epic knob added with overheads transposed down an octave, should probably be removed
Bleed controls still not implemented, present on GUI but they do nothing
Still WAV

Alpha 0.200
All mics now mapped and have volume controls and width for the stereo ones
Bleed controls not set up yet but other controls working
Kick dampen control probably much too aggressive, unless we want to do hip-hop
Cymbal tune control is, again, pretty much for sounding like samples of old records
No basic patch yet
No separate mic mapping patches yet
Still WAV

Alpha 0.110
Missing snare buzz 2 layer added
Hi-hat pedal map fixed
Controls common to all mics added
Hi-hat muting has hierarchy now
Hi-hat mapping modularized so it can be switched to using CC4 for the hi-hat pedal
Still just overhead, still WAV

Alpha 0.100
All kit pieces mapped with overhead mic only so far
Mapping files have backslashes, will need mass search-replace for Mac and Linux users
No controls except for snare on/off and snare roll dynamics
Each kit piece has some polyphony limitations, so the total number of voices as well as the sound buildup can be controlled
WAV files not FLAC
Hi-hat muting is very simple for now
Snare buzz velocity layer 2 file missing, will need reexport
Once the above two things are fixed, it should be trivial to adjust the mapping for all other mic positions
