# Virtuosity Drums

Contemporary Jazz drum kit library, performed with sticks, recorded at [Virtuosity Musical Instruments](https://www.virtuosityboston.com) in Boston, MA.

It features performances by drummer Austin McMahon on the shop's "house kit", indicative of a typical setup in a live club or venue, recorded in the style of a live recording. With six mixable mic positions and detailed controls, it will work in many other genres too.
